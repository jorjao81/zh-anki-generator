    <b>Origin: Pictograph (象形字)</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        The character <span class="hanzi">亏</span> is a pictograph. Its ancient form depicted a puff of breath or vital energy (气) being exhaled from a person's mouth, or an empty vessel. This exhalation or emptiness represents a loss of energy or substance. Therefore, the character's original and core meaning is <b>'deficiency', 'shortage',</b> or <b>'loss'</b>.

    <b>The Semantic Evolution:</b>

<ul>
    <li>
        Its most direct meaning is <b>"to suffer a loss,"</b> especially in a financial or social context. This is seen in the very common phrases <span class="hanzi">亏本</span> (kuīběn), "to lose money in business," and <span class="hanzi">吃亏</span> (chīkuī), "to be at a disadvantage." A company's financial loss is a <span class="hanzi">亏损</span> (kuīsǔn).
    </li>
    <li>
        From the idea of causing a loss to others, it also means <b>"to treat unfairly"</b> or <b>"to let down."</b> For example, <span class="hanzi">我不能亏待你</span> (Wǒ bùnéng kuīdài nǐ) means "I can't treat you unfairly." A guilty conscience is a <span class="hanzi">心亏</span> (xīnkuī).

        <b>Special Evolution:</b> In a surprising rhetorical shift, it developed an adverbial meaning of <b>"fortunately"</b> or <b>"thanks to."</b> This evolved from the polite expression of "being at a loss without" someone's help (e.g., "Thanks to you, I was not at a loss"). It is often seen as <span class="hanzi">幸亏</span> (xìngkuī).
    </li>
    <li>
        For example, <span class="hanzi">幸亏你来了，不然我们就输了。</span> (Xìngkuī nǐ lái le, bùrán wǒmen jiù shū le), "Fortunately you came, otherwise we would have lost."
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Loss of breath</b> (Pictograph) → <b>Deficiency / Loss</b> (Original meaning) → <b>To treat unfairly</b> (To cause a loss) → <b>Fortunately / Thanks to</b> (Rhetorical shift).
    </li>
