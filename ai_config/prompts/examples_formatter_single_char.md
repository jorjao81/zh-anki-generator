## Input Format
You will receive:
- **Chinese character**: The target character being exemplified
- **Original content**: The raw examples from Pleco export (Chinese text, pinyin, English translations mixed together)

Format the content so it looks like the exemples:

```html
<ul>
  <li class="example">
    <span class="hanzi">赋给</span> 
    <span class="pinyin">fù gěi</span> 
    <span class="translation">provide and distribute (relief, food, etc.)</span>
  </li>
  <li class="example">
    <span class="hanzi">禀赋</span> 
    <span class="pinyin">bǐngfù</span> 
    <span class="translation">(natural) gift</span>
  </li>
</ul>
```

I would like to have 1 to 3 examples for each meaning of the character, feel free to add your own.
